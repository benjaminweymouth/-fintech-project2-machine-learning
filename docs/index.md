##  Housing Market Forecasting: NLP and Time Series Analysis

Our analysis of the Housing market uses three pipelines to provide predictive analytical insights. We utilize a dual pipeline, leveraging both qualitative and quantitative tools. 

##  Quantitative Analysis: VAR and VARMAX:  

The quantitative conclusion is that the current large trends will continue with some peaks and valleys. In short, since the Housing Affordability Index predicted to go up- this means that it will be more difficult for Canadians to afford a home. Both VAR and VARMAX models support this conclusion

##  Qualitative / NLP Analysis:  

The Negative sentiment articles in the canadian press ros significantly during the last period corroborating our quantitative results of a an imminent change in the actual trends, there is a significant worry about the change in the Canadian Housing Market especially with the retraction of the low interest rates introduced during Covid by Bank of Canada making mortgages higher and driving the loans rates to a newer high.

Overall Analysis:  

We conclude that from both pipelines, there is a an imminent change coming which would align with the downturn that was in our hypothesis. We believe that the three pipelines in our analysis shown in our Jupyter notebooks support this conclusion.
