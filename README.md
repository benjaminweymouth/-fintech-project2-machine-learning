## Introduction
This jupyter notebook will utilize VAR, VARMAX and auto-arima to look at the long-term trends in the Canadian housing market to give us some indication of the future trends. VAR, VARMAX and auto-ARIMA will provide predictive modelling using multivariate analysis, similar to the VAR analysis. However, this will be a different analysis using VARMAX.

## Hypothesis
Our hypothesis for VARMAS will be similar to the VAR analysis. We will take quantitative data in order to make a conclusion for the future. We will utilize VAR and VARMAX: two different models to acheive an understanding of multivariate analysis and how to pick the best predictive tool. Our hypothesis is that the Canadian housing market will experience a downturn similar to the American Housing Crash of 2008.

## DataSets and Feature Selection
In order to prove our analysis we will utilize various sources. We will utilize data from the Bank of Canada, from Statistics Canada and from news sources. This Jupyter Notebook specifically will focus on the second of two multivariate forecasting models: VARMAX with Auto ARIMA.

For our feature selection we will use Residential Mortgage figures, The Housing Affordability Index, Prime rate figures and figures outlining the 5-year Conventional mortgage in Canada.
